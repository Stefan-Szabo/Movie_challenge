Foundation for a program for movie fanatics to keep track of what movies they have watched and how many times they watched each movie.

The program supports the following:

class Movie - models a movie which includes
- movie name
- movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - the number of times the movie has been watched

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie object
However, our main driver should only interact with the Movies class.


Additionally, 
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection 
we should display this error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not in the movies
collection we should display this error to the user
